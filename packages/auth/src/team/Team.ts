   * as a TLS connection to a trusted address is sufficient to ensure the security of that
   * connection. In response, the server should send back its public keys. This library is not
   * involved in that process.
   *
   * The application should then add the server to the team using `addServer`, passing in the
   * server's public keys. At that point the server will be able to authenticate with other devices
   * using the same protocol as for members.
