/**
 * Each link has a `type` and a `payload`, just like a Redux action. So we can derive a `TeamState`
 * from a `TeamGraph`, by applying a Redux-style reducer to the array of links. The reducer runs on
 * each link in sequence, accumulating a team state.
 *
 * > *Note:* Keep in mind that this reducer is a pure function that acts on the publicly available
 * links in the signature chain, and must independently return the same result for every member. It
 * knows nothing about the current user's context, and it does not have access to any secrets. Any
 * crypto operations using secret keys that **the current user has** must happen elsewhere.
 *
 * @param state The team state as of the previous link in the signature chain.
 * @param link The current link being processed.
